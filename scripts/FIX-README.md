# Script File Fix

## Issue

Several JavaScript files in the `scripts` directory have been corrupted. The files appear to have been concatenated multiple times, resulting in duplicate variable declarations. This causes the following error when running the scripts:

```
SyntaxError: Identifier 'fs' has already been declared
```

The affected files are:
- `fix-python-path.js`
- `fix-redis-connection.js`
- `fix-memory-issues.js`
- `quick-diagnose.js`

## Solution

Fixed versions of these files have been created with the `.new` extension. A script called `replace-files.js` has been created to replace the corrupted files with the fixed versions.

## How to Fix

Run the following command to replace the corrupted files with the fixed versions:

```
node scripts/replace-files.js
```

This will:
1. Create backups of the original files with the `.bak` extension
2. Replace the corrupted files with the fixed versions
3. Remove the `.new` files

After running this script, you should be able to run the original scripts without errors.

## Verification

After replacing the files, you can verify that the fix worked by running:

```
node scripts/quick-diagnose.js
```

If the script runs without errors, the fix was successful.

## Manual Fix (if needed)

If the automatic fix doesn't work, you can manually replace each file:

1. Rename the corrupted file (e.g., `fix-python-path.js` to `fix-python-path.js.bak`)
2. Rename the fixed file (e.g., `fix-python-path.js.new` to `fix-python-path.js`)

Repeat for each affected file.
