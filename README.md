# Sports Analytics Platform

## Overview
Our sports analytics platform is an enterprise-grade predictive analytics system for professional sports. The platform combines advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and real-time data analytics to provide high-accuracy predictions for various professional sports leagues including NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, and major soccer leagues.

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key components:

### 1. Core Prediction Engine
- **Factor Parser**: Sophisticated NLP engine that parses natural language descriptions of sporting events and conditions
- **Custom Prediction Model**: ML-based prediction system with Bayesian uncertainty quantification
- **Model Monitoring System**: Continuous evaluation and recalibration of prediction models

### 2. API Layer
- **Premium Prediction API**: Enterprise-grade API with both REST and GraphQL endpoints
- **Real-time WebSocket Service**: For live game updates and prediction adjustments
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT authentication, API key validation, and rate limiting

### 3. Frontend Components
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualization and analysis of predictions
- **Voice-enabled Interface**: Natural language queries for predictions
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities for offline prediction

## Key Features

### Advanced Prediction Capabilities
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Calculate combined probabilities across multiple related factors
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian approach to confidence intervals and risk assessment
- **League-specific Models**: Specialized models for each supported sports league
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjust predictions based on live game events, player status changes, and odds movements

### User Experience
- **Natural Language Interface**: Enter predictions in plain English
- **Voice Recognition**: Speak predictions directly to the platform
- **Interactive Visualizations**: D3-based visualizations for prediction analysis
- **Comparison Tools**: Compare multiple predictions side-by-side with statistical analysis

### Enterprise Features
- **High Performance**: Efficient processing of concurrent prediction requests
- **Comprehensive Security**: Authentication, encryption, and secure data handling
- **Detailed Analytics**: Insightful dashboards for prediction performance
- **Export Capabilities**: Export predictions and analysis in multiple formats

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Technologies
- **Python**: Core prediction models and NLP processing
- **FastAPI**: High-performance API framework
- **Redis**: Caching and rate limiting
- **MongoDB**: Prediction storage and history
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Machine learning models

### Frontend Technologies
- **JavaScript/React**: Interactive user interface
- **D3.js**: Advanced data visualizations
- **IndexedDB**: Offline data storage
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates

### MLOps Infrastructure
- **Model Registry**: Version control for prediction models
- **Automated Recalibration**: Regular model updates based on outcomes
- **Adversarial Testing**: Robust model validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of prediction accuracy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with required packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Node.js 14+ with npm
- Redis server
- MongoDB instance
- Sports data API access (for training and validation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/sports-analytics.git
cd sports-analytics
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
python scripts/initialize_db.py
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Documentation

The platform provides both REST and GraphQL APIs for prediction services.

### REST Endpoints

#### Single Factor Prediction
```
POST /api/predict/single
```

Request:
```json
{
  "factor": "LeBron James scores more than 25 points",
  "league": "NBA",
  "include_supporting_data": true
}
```

#### Multi-Factor Prediction
```
POST /api/predict/multi
```

Request:
```json
{
  "factors": [
    "LeBron James scores more than 25 points",
    "Lakers win against the Warriors",
    "Total game points over 220"
  ],
  "league": "NBA",
  "max_factors": 5
}
```

### GraphQL API

The GraphQL API provides more flexible queries and is available at `/graphql`.

Example query:
```graphql
query {
  predictFactor(input: {
    factor: "LeBron James scores more than 25 points"
    league: "NBA"
    includeSupportingData: true
  }) {
    requestId
    timestamp
    factor
    result {
      probability
      confidence
      prediction
      supportingData
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for prediction models
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing for performance validation

### Pre-Launch Verification
Use the verification script to ensure all components are properly connected:

```bash
node scripts/verify_connections.js
```

This will check:
- Environment variable configuration
- Database connections
- Python dependencies
- Module imports
- API endpoints
- Frontend dependencies

### Benchmarking
Run benchmarks to validate prediction performance:

```bash
node scripts/benchmark_predictions.js
```
