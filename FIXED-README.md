## How to Run the Fixed Version

1. Make the optimized start script executable:
   ```

   ```

2. Run the application using the optimized start script:
   ```
   ./start-optimized.sh
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Web interface: http://localhost:5050
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:5050/dashboard
   - Health check: http://localhost:5050/api/health

## Monitoring

You can monitor the application's health and memory usage using the following endpoints:

- Basic health check: http://localhost:5050/api/health
- Detailed health check: http://localhost:5050/api/health/detailed
- Memory usage: http://localhost:5050/api/health/memory

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the `logs` directory
2. Verify Python installation and dependencies
3. Increase memory limit in `start-optimized.sh` if needed
4. Try running with `PYTHON_ENABLED=false` to use fallback mode
