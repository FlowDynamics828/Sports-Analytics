   - Conversion funnels and drop-offs

2. **Qualitative Feedback**
   - In-app feedback mechanism
   - Scheduled user interviews
   - Daily user journals
   - Post-testing surveys

3. **Usability Assessment**
   - Task completion rates
   - Time-on-task measurements
   - User satisfaction scores
   - System Usability Scale (SUS) survey

## Test Execution Process

### Pre-Testing Setup

1. Prepare test environment and data
2. Create test accounts and documentation
3. Set up monitoring tools
4. Conduct internal smoke tests
5. Create user onboarding materials

### Testing Kickoff

1. Conduct orientation session with test users
2. Provide documentation and support channels
3. Assign initial test scenarios
4. Set expectations for feedback frequency

### Daily Testing Operations

1. Morning: System health check and reset test data if needed
2. Daily: Monitor user activity and support requests
3. Evening: Collect daily logs and prepare summary
4. Weekly: Conduct check-in calls with test users

### Issue Management

1. Establish severity classification system
   - Critical: Blocking functionality, data loss, security issues
   - High: Major feature not working as expected
   - Medium: Non-critical functionality issues
   - Low: UI/UX improvements, minor bugs

2. Issue resolution workflow
   - Logging: User reports or system detection
   - Triage: Assess severity and assign
   - Resolution: Fix implementation
   - Verification: Testing fix
   - Communication: Update users on status

## Feedback Collection Templates
