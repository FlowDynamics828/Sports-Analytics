## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python Script Path Issue
- **Problem**: The Python script 'predictive_model.py' could not be found at the path 'C:\Users\d07ch\OneDrive\Desktop\Sports Analytics\sports-analytics\predictive_model.py'.
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `pythonBridge.js` to properly check if the script exists before attempting to run it
  - Added explicit error handling with detailed error messages
  - Added verification in `api.js` to check if the Python script exists at startup

### 2. Redis Connection Failures
- **Problem**: Redis connections were failing without proper error handling and recovery.
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced Redis connection handling in `cache.js` with proper event listener cleanup
  - Added connection verification with PING
  - Improved error handling to gracefully fall back to in-memory cache
  - Increased connection timeout for better reliability

### 3. WebSocket Memory Leaks
- **Problem**: WebSocket server was causing EventEmitter memory leaks due to uncleaned intervals and listeners.
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper tracking of interval references in `websocket-server.js`
  - Implemented proper cleanup of all intervals during shutdown
  - Added listener limits to prevent EventEmitter warnings
  - Enhanced the graceful shutdown process with timeouts and error handling
  - Added garbage collection triggers during high memory usage

### 4. High Memory Usage
- **Problem**: The application was experiencing frequent high memory usage warnings.
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced the `MemoryMonitor` class with more aggressive cleanup strategies
  - Implemented tiered response to memory pressure based on severity
  - Added periodic cleanup of historical data to prevent memory bloat
  - Optimized data storage by using more efficient formats (MB instead of bytes)
  - Added consecutive high usage tracking to identify persistent issues

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Review the `.env` file to ensure all paths are correctly set for your environment
- Update `PYTHON_PATH` to match your system's Python installation
- Consider setting up a virtual environment for Python dependencies

### 2. Redis Configuration
- Ensure Redis server is installed and running on the configured host/port
- For development, you can use:
  ```
  npm install redis-server --save-dev
  ```
  And add a startup script to package.json:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start-redis": "redis-server",
    "start": "node api.js"
  }
  ```

### 3. Python Dependencies
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed:
  ```
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm hyperopt pymongo python-dotenv redis prometheus-client psutil cachetools
  ```
  
### 4. Memory Management
- Consider implementing a memory usage dashboard to monitor application performance
- Set up alerts for persistent high memory usage
- Review large data structures in the application for optimization opportunities
- Consider implementing pagination for large dataset operations

### 5. Error Handling
- Implement centralized error tracking and reporting
- Add more detailed logging for critical operations
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies

### 6. Testing
- Add comprehensive tests for the Python bridge functionality
- Implement load testing to identify memory leaks under stress
- Add integration tests for Redis and WebSocket components

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Set up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring
2. Implement health check endpoints for all major components
3. Add alerting for critical failures
4. Implement log aggregation for easier troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. Review the application for other potential memory leaks
2. Consider implementing a more robust caching strategy
3. Evaluate the need for clustering to improve reliability
